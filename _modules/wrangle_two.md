R has undergone a transformation in the past few years and this may
affect how you choose to approach data wrangling. While the core R
functions for data manipulation are still the same, a new suite of
packages, the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) (formerly known as
the “Hadleyverse” after their key creator, [Hadley
Wickham](http://hadley.nz)), has really changed the way many people use
R.

In this module, I’m going to show you how to wrangle data the tidyverse
way. The sequence is almost the same as those in the last module. In the
end, it’s up to you which approach you prefer.

Data for this module are the same as those used in the last, from the
[NCES Education Longitudinal Study of
2002](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/). For descriptions of the
variables, see the <a href = '{{ site.baseurl
}}/data/#els_planscsv'>codebook</a>. If you saved your cleaned up data
set using the same name, go ahead and download a fresh copy of the
original data.

# Tidyverse

The tidyverse is a shorthand for a [number of
packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) that work well together
and can be used in place of base R functions. A few of the tidyverse
packages that you will often use are:

  - [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org) for data manipulation  
  - [tidyr](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org) for making data
    [tidy](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html)  
  - [readr](http://readr.tidyverse.org) for flat file I/O  
  - [readxl](http://readxl.tidyverse.org) for Excel file I/O  
  - [haven](http://haven.tidyverse.org) for other file format I/O  
  - [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) for making graphics

There are many others. A lot of R users find functions from these
libraries to be more intuitive than base R functions. In some cases,
tidyverse functions are faster than base R, which is an added benefit
when working with large data sets.

## Magrittr and pipes

The key feature of the tidyverse is its use of pipes, `%>%`, from the
[magrittr package](http://magrittr.tidyverse.org).

<span style="display:block;text-align:center">
[![badge](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/magrittr.png)](https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/uploads/exhibitions/images/magritte_la_trahison_des_images_large@2x.jpg)
</span>

Pipes take output from the left side and pipe it to the input of the
right side. So `sum(x)` can be rewritten as `x %>% sum`: `x` outputs
itself and the pipe, `%>%`, makes it the input for `sum()`.

This is a silly example (why would you do that?), but pipes are powerful
because they can be chained together. Functions can be nested in R, but
after too many, the code becomes difficult to parse since it has to be
read from the inside out. Pipes allow functions to come one after
another in the order of the work being done.

Let’s use [Hadley’s canonical
example](https://twitter.com/_inundata/status/557980236130689024) to
make the readability comparison between nested functions and piped
functions clearer:

``` r
## foo_foo is an instance of a little bunny
foo_foo <- little_bunny()

## adventures in base R must be read from the middle up and backwards
bop_on(
    scoop_up(
        hop_through(foo_foo, forest),
        field_mouse
    ),
    head
)

## adventures w/ pipes start at the top and work down
foo_foo %>%
    hop_through(forest) %>%
    scoop_up(field_mouse) %>%
    bop_on(head)
```

Let’s reread the original data. Like `read.table()`, `read_delim()` is
the generic function that needs you to give it the separating/delimiting
character. You could also just use `read_csv()`.

``` r
## read in the data
df <- read_delim('../data/els_plans.csv', delim = ',')
```

    Parsed with column specification:
    cols(
      .default = col_double(),
      psu = col_character(),
      bysex = col_character(),
      byrace = col_character(),
      bypared = col_character(),
      bymothed = col_character(),
      byfathed = col_character(),
      byincome = col_character(),
      bystexp = col_character(),
      f1psepln = col_character(),
      f2ps1sec = col_character()
    )

    See spec(...) for full column specifications.

Unlike the base R `read.table()` function, `read_delim()` prints out
information about how the data were read in. Nothing is wrong\! The
`read_delim()` function, like many other functions in the tidyverse,
assumes you’d rather have more rather than less information and so acts
accordingly.

We can see which columns were read in as doubles (`col_double()`) and
which as integers (`col_integer()`). If the column name isn’t in the
list, then it was read in as the `.default`, which was as a character
column (`col_character()`).

## Mutate

To add variables and change existing ones, use the `mutate()` function.

Most if not all of the primary tidyverse functions take the data object
as the first argument. So the `mutate()` function would be `mutate(df,
...)` where `...` is the stuff we want to do. Because we’re using the
`%>%`, however, we start with the data by itself and pipe it into the
`mutate()` function. We’ll do this with the rest of the tidyverse
functions. While not necessary, I think it helps reading through the
code: *Starting with the data (`df`), we next create new variables with
the `mutate()` function…* and so on.

Note that with tidyverse functions, you usually don’t need to use the
data frame name with the dollar sign construction (`df$<var_name>`) and
you don’t need to put quotation marks around the column names. There are
some rare cases where you do, but we won’t get into those.

``` r
## assign values inside function using = sign (not <-)
df <- df %>%
    mutate(ones = 1,
           avg_test = (bynels2r + bynels2m) / 2) # ignore neg vals
```

To conditionally mutate variables, use the `ifelse()` construction
inside the `mutate()` function.

``` r
## (1) make a numeric column that == 1 if bysex is female, 0 otherwise
## (2) assign DOB an NA if < 0
df <- df %>%
    mutate(female = ifelse(bysex == 'female', 1, 0),
           bydob_p = ifelse(bydob_p < 0, NA, bydob_p))           
```

> #### Quick exercise
> 
> Create dummy variables for each race/ethnicity category in `byrace`.
> (Hint: use (`table()`) to see the possible values; adv. hint:
> `ifelse()` statements can be nested.)

## Select

To choose variables, either when making a new data frame or dropping
them, use `select()`. Without assignment (because we would change our
data object and we don’t want to), let’s use `select()` to view the
first few rows of the student and school ids.

``` r
## just view first few rows of stu_id and sch_id (no assignment)
df %>% select(stu_id, sch_id)
```

    # A tibble: 16,160 x 2
       stu_id sch_id
        <dbl>  <dbl>
     1 101101   1011
     2 101102   1011
     3 101104   1011
     4 101105   1011
     5 101106   1011
     6 101107   1011
     7 101108   1011
     8 101109   1011
     9 101110   1011
    10 101111   1011
    # ... with 16,150 more rows

To drop variables, use a negative sign (`-`) in front of the variable
name. This time, we will reassign the results to `df`, which means that
the column `f1pnlwt` will be dropped from the data frame.

``` r
## drop follow up one panel weight
df <- df %>% select(-f1pnlwt)

## check names
names(df)
```

``` 
 [1] "stu_id"   "sch_id"   "strat_id" "psu"      "f1sch_id" "bystuwt" 
 [7] "bysex"    "byrace"   "bydob_p"  "bypared"  "bymothed" "byfathed"
[13] "byincome" "byses1"   "byses2"   "bystexp"  "bynels2m" "bynels2r"
[19] "f1qwt"    "f1psepln" "f2ps1sec" "ones"     "avg_test" "female"  
```

## Filter

Like `select()` works on columns, `filter()` can be used to subset based
on row conditions. Earlier we properly labeled `bydob_p` values less
than zero as `NA`. Let’s drop those.

``` r
## show number of rows
nrow(df)
```

    [1] 16160

``` r
## keep if not (!) missing
df <- df %>% filter(!is.na(bydob_p))
nrow(df)
```

    [1] 15183

> it in two steps, first `mutate()`ing negative values to be `NA` and
> then `filter()`ing out missing values, or in one step, just
> `filter()`ing out if `bysex` has a value below zero.

## Arrange

Sort values using the `arrange()`
function.

``` r
## show first few rows of student and base year math scores (tidyverse way)
df %>% select(stu_id, bydob_p) %>% head(10)
```

    # A tibble: 10 x 2
       stu_id bydob_p
        <dbl>   <dbl>
     1 101101  198512
     2 101102  198605
     3 101104  198601
     4 101105  198607
     5 101106  198511
     6 101107  198510
     7 101108  198607
     8 101109  198512
     9 101110  198505
    10 101111  198507

``` r
## arrange
df <- df %>% arrange(bydob_p)

## show again first few rows of ID and DOB
df %>% select(stu_id, bydob_p) %>% head(10)
```

    # A tibble: 10 x 2
       stu_id bydob_p
        <dbl>   <dbl>
     1 133211  198300
     2 195210  198300
     3 195213  198300
     4 225203  198300
     5 268219  198300
     6 268225  198300
     7 274222  198300
     8 280215  198300
     9 324119  198300
    10 327128  198300

## Summarize

Aggregate data using the `summarise()` or `summarize()` function
(they’re the same, just playing nice by offering both spellings).
Unlike the `aggregate()` function, you first need to set the grouping
variable using the `group_by()` function. Since we need to replace
negative values before we summarize, we’ll chain a few functions
together into one command.

Notice how we can include comment rows between each piped command.
Adding a comment before each function that explains the step in a
human-friendly manner can be particularly helpful when chaining multiple
functions together. Or you can work the other way, writing
[pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) first and then
adding the R code afterwards.

``` r
## create new data frame
sch_m <- df %>%
    ## (1) make test score values < 0 into NAs
    mutate(bynels2m = ifelse(bynels2m < 0, NA, bynels2m)) %>%
    ## (2) group by school ID
    group_by(sch_id) %>%
    ## (3) get the average math score, removing missing values
    summarise(sch_bynels2m = mean(bynels2m, na.rm = TRUE))

## show
sch_m
```

    # A tibble: 751 x 2
       sch_id sch_bynels2m
        <dbl>        <dbl>
     1   1011         45.3
     2   1012         43.3
     3   1021         28.9
     4   1022         38.6
     5   1031         40.0
     6   1032         35.3
     7   1033         42.2
     8   1041         44.9
     9   1042         52.2
    10   1051         45.9
    # ... with 741 more rows

> #### Quick exercise

> Find the average reading test score for each school and save it in an
> object.

The `group_by()` and `summarise()` functions are very useful for
generating summary statistics and exploring your data. We’ll use them
more in the modules on exploratory data analysis.

## Join

Rather than saying “merge,” dplyr uses the SQL language of joins:

  - `left_join(x, y)`: keep all x, drop unmatched y
  - `right_join(x, y)`: keep all y, drop unmatched x
  - `inner_join(x, y)`: keep only matching
  - `full_join(x, y)`: keep everything

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/joins.png" alt="Joins">

Since we want to join a smaller aggregated data frame to the original
data frame, we’ll use a `left_join()`. The join functions will try to
guess the joining variable (and tell you what it picked) if you don’t
supply one, but we’ll specify one to be clear.

``` r
## join on school ID variable
df <- df %>% left_join(sch_m, by = 'sch_id')
```

> #### Quick exercise
> 
> Join the average reading test score data frame you made to the main
> data object.

## Write

The readr library can also write delimited flat files. Instead of
`write_delim()`, we’ll use the wrapper function `write_csv()` to save a
csv file. Again, it’s a good habit to save any modified data using a
different name so that your raw data stays untouched. We’ll add
`_mod_tv` to the data name so that we don’t overwrite raw data or the
modified data set we made in the last module.

``` r
## write flat file
write_csv(df, '../data/els_plans_mod_tv.csv')
```
