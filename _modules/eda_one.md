This module takes the first steps in more formally exploring a data set.
Because building and cleaning a data set is often an iterative process,
especially in the early stages of a project, some of the techniques
below could still be considered part of data wrangling.

# Using data from another program

Doing data analysis often means working in teams, which, in turn, can
mean working with a variety of programs and file types. When you need to
use data that aren’t flat files (those ending in `*.txt`, `*.csv`, or
`*.tsv`, for example) or in an R format, you can use one of the
following libraries:

  - [readxl](http://readxl.tidyverse.org)
      - Excel: `read_excel()`
  - [haven](http://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html)
      - Stata: `read_dta()`, `write_dta()`
      - SAS: `read_sas()`, `write_sas()`
      - SPSS: `read_sav()`, `write_sav()`

For practice, we’ll use the same ELS plans data set as before, but this
time stored in a Stata `*.dta` file.

One benefit of Stata and other stats programs like SAS is that you can
label variables and values. Base R data frames don’t support labels, but
[tibbles](http://tibble.tidyverse.org) (`tbl_df()`) in the tidyverse do.
By default, the `read_dta()` function we’ll use reads the data into a
tibble. So that we can work with the variable and value labels that were
saved in the `*dta` file, we’ll also load the
[labelled](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/labelled/vignettes/intro_labelled.html)
library.

``` r
## libraries: tidyverse + haven and labelled
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(labelled)
```

``` r
## read in Stata dta file
df <- read_dta('../data/els_plans.dta')
```

## Labels

First, let’s take a quick bird’s eye view of our data. In RStudio, you
can use the `View()` command or just click on the data object in the
**Environment** window. You can see the variable labels under the
variable names in the view.

You can also use the `glimpse()` function to see a nicely formatted
glimpse of the data

``` r
## use glimpse
glimpse(df)
```

    $ f2ps1sec <dbl+lbl> NA, 1, 1, 4, 4, NA, 4, 2, NA, 4, 1, NA, NA, 4, 2,...

The `glimpse()` function doesn’t show the labels, but it does let you
know that columns like `bysex` have them with the `<dbl+lbl>` tag.

To see the variable labels, use the `var_label()` function. Notice that
we can just add it to the end of the function chain, letting the pipe
(`%>%`) input the selected columns.

``` r
## show the labels for just a few variables
df %>%
    select(stu_id, bysex, bypared, bynels2m) %>%
    var_label()
```

    $stu_id
    [1] "student id"
    
    $bysex
    [1] "sex-composite"
    
    $bypared
    [1] "parents^ highest level of education"
    
    $bynels2m
    [1] "els-nels 1992 scale equated sophomore math score"

Unfortunately, the label for the `bysex` column doesn’t really tell us
anything that we probably didn’t already guess based on the variable
name. The problem with the name and label is that it is ambiguous.
Unfortunately, so are the values:

``` r
## who first few rows of bysex
df %>% select(bysex)
```

    # A tibble: 16,160 x 1
       bysex    
       <dbl+lbl>
     1 2        
     2 2        
     3 2        
     4 2        
     5 2        
     6 1        
     7 1        
     8 1        
     9 1        
    10 1        
    # ... with 16,150 more rows

What does having a value of 1 or 2 mean? Use the `val_labels()` function
to see.

``` r
## see value labels for bysex
df %>% select(bysex) %>% val_labels()
```

    $bysex
    {survey component legitimate skip/na} 
                                       -8 
                          {nonrespondent} 
                                       -4 
                                     male 
                                        1 
                                   female 
                                        2 

Okay. In this data set, male students are coded as 1 and female students
are coded as 2.

It turns out that the `head()` function (which works with regular data
frames and vectors) will also give the value labels if it’s given a
tibble and the values are labelled.

``` r
## show more information about bysex variable
head(df$bysex)
```

    <Labelled double>: sex-composite
    [1] 2 2 2 2 2 1
    
    Labels:
     value                                 label
        -8 {survey component legitimate skip/na}
        -4                       {nonrespondent}
         1                                  male
         2                                female

Moving forward, it probably will be clearer if we generate a new
indicator variable. For example, we could create the variable `female`
that equals one if `bysex` is 2 and 0 otherwise.

``` r
## create an indicator variable for female
df <- df %>%
    mutate(female = ifelse(bysex == 2, 1, 0))
```

# Summary statistics

## Continuous values

We can get the mean and standard deviation of continuous variables using
the `mean()` and `sd()` functions…

``` r
## get mean and sd
mean(df$bynels2m)
```

    [1] NA

``` r
sd(df$bynels2m)
```

    [1] NA

…except that `bynels2m` has missing values and R doesn’t automatically
drop those when calculating those statistics. It can be a little
annoying at first, but really it’s a nice feature because it lets you
know that your data aren’t complete.

To ignore `NA`s, set the `na.rm` argument to `TRUE`.

``` r
## find mean and sd, telling R to remove NAs
mean(df$bynels2m, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    [1] 45.35452

``` r
sd(df$bynels2m, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    [1] 13.53664

> #### Quick exercise
> 
> Find the mean and standard deviation of reading scores.

You can also compute summary statistics using
[dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org) and the `summarise_all()`,
`summarise_at()`, and `summarise_if()` functions. Since we want to focus
on one variable, we’ll use the `summarise_at()` function. (More
information about the other commands can be found
[here](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise_all.html).)

The `summarise_at()` function takes two main arguments, `.vars` and
`.funs`. These are exactly what they sound like. `.vars` wants to know
which variables (or columns) you want to work with. Wrap the ones you
want in the `vars()` (no dot, `.`) function. `.funs` wants to know the
summarizing function(s) you want, this time wrapped in the `funs()`
function.

The `funs()` function can also take an argument, `.args = list()`, in
which you can put all the arguments you want passed to the summarizing
functions. Since we want `mean()` and `sd()` to ignore missing values,
we put `na.rm = TRUE` in the `list()` that we pass to `.args()`. Keep in
mind that the arguments in the `.args` list are passed to each and every
function in `funs()`. Note that it may not always be the case that all
the functions in `funs()` can take the same arguments, but it’s okay and
even efficient in our case since we only have to include `na.rm = TRUE`
once.

``` r
## mean and sd using dplyr
df %>%
    summarise_at(.vars = vars(bynels2m),
                 .funs = funs(mean, sd, .args = list(na.rm = TRUE)))
```

    # A tibble: 1 x 2
       mean    sd
      <dbl> <dbl>
    1  45.4  13.5

> #### Quick exercise
> 
> Modify the above code to summarize reading scores at the same time.

## Discrete values

Use the `table()` function for discrete variables. Because we know or
maybe suspect that there are missing values, we add the `useNA` argument
with the argument `'ifany'`.

``` r
## table of parental education levels
table(df$bypared, useNA = 'ifany')
```

``` 

   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 <NA> 
 942 3044 1663 1597 1758 3466 1785 1049  856 
```

Unfortunately, these numbers don’t mean much without reference to a code
book. However, because are data are labelled, we can use the
`as_factor()` function to see the labels.

``` r
## use as_factor() to get the value labels
table(as_factor(df$bypared), useNA = 'ifany')
```

``` 

                               {missing} 
                                       0 
   {survey component legitimate skip/na} 
                                       0 
                         {nonrespondent} 
                                       0 
              did not finish high school 
                                     942 
       graduated from high school or ged 
                                    3044 
       attended 2-year school, no degree 
                                    1663 
            graduated from 2-year school 
                                    1597 
      attended college, no 4-year degree 
                                    1758 
                  graduated from college 
                                    3466 
 completed master^s degree or equivalent 
                                    1785 
completed phd, md, other advanced degree 
                                    1049 
                                    <NA> 
                                     856 
```

Now we can see what the numbers represent. Why aren’t there any counts
for the three missing labels, the ones with braces, while there are a
number of `NA` values? Checking how the labels are assigned using the
`val_labels()` function…

``` r
## check how bypared labels are assigned
val_labels(df$bypared)
```

``` 
                               {missing} 
                                      -9 
   {survey component legitimate skip/na} 
                                      -8 
                         {nonrespondent} 
                                      -4 
              did not finish high school 
                                       1 
       graduated from high school or ged 
                                       2 
       attended 2-year school, no degree 
                                       3 
            graduated from 2-year school 
                                       4 
      attended college, no 4-year degree 
                                       5 
                  graduated from college 
                                       6 
 completed master^s degree or equivalent 
                                       7 
completed phd, md, other advanced degree 
                                       8 
```

…confirms that when the original data values indicating missingness were
changed from negative numbers to `.` in Stata, the labels no longer
applied. At the moment, we don’t care why the values are missing, but if
we did, would have to find the original Stata data set that retained the
negative values.

To generate counts using dplyr, use the `count()` function. By chaining
`as_factor()` to the end of the call, we can get the counts with
associated labels. Notice that unlike `table()` in base R, `count()`
includes missing values in the output.

``` r
## using dplyr to make a table
df %>%
    count(bypared) %>%
    as_factor()
```

    # A tibble: 9 x 2
      bypared                                      n
      <fct>                                    <int>
    1 did not finish high school                 942
    2 graduated from high school or ged         3044
    3 attended 2-year school, no degree         1663
    4 graduated from 2-year school              1597
    5 attended college, no 4-year degree        1758
    6 graduated from college                    3466
    7 completed master^s degree or equivalent   1785
    8 completed phd, md, other advanced degree  1049
    9 <NA>                                       856

## Two-way table

Cross tabulations are also useful. With the `table()` function, instead
of calling just `table(x)`, that is, `table()` with one column, call
`table(x, y)`, where `x` and `y` are two columns with discrete values.

``` r
## table of parental education levels
table(as_factor(df$bypared), as_factor(df$bysex))
```

``` 
                                          
                                           {survey component legitimate skip/na}

To make a cross table with dplyr, use `group_by()` before `count()` to
generate counts within groups.

``` r
## use the group_by() and count() functions to make two-way table
df %>%
    group_by(bysex) %>%
    count(bypared) %>%
    as_factor()
```

    # A tibble: 19 x 3
    # Groups:   bysex [3]
       bysex  bypared                                      n
       <fct>  <fct>                                    <int>
     1 male   did not finish high school                 440
     2 male   graduated from high school or ged         1496
     3 male   attended 2-year school, no degree          823
     4 male   graduated from 2-year school               849
     5 male   attended college, no 4-year degree         859
     6 male   graduated from college                    1737
     7 male   completed master^s degree or equivalent    911
     8 male   completed phd, md, other advanced degree   503
     9 male   <NA>                                        21
    10 female did not finish high school                 502
    11 female graduated from high school or ged         1548
    12 female attended 2-year school, no degree          840
    13 female graduated from 2-year school               748
    14 female attended college, no 4-year degree         899
    15 female graduated from college                    1729
    16 female completed master^s degree or equivalent    874
    17 female completed phd, md, other advanced degree   546
    18 female <NA>                                        16
    19 <NA>   <NA>                                       819

To make the dplyr table look more like the table made with base R, use
the `spread()` function from tidyr.

``` r
## spread to look like other table
df %>%
    group_by(bysex) %>%
    count(bypared) %>%
    as_factor() %>%
    spread(bysex, n)
```

    # A tibble: 9 x 4
      bypared                                   male female `<NA>`
      <fct>                                    <int>  <int>  <int>
    1 did not finish high school                 440    502     NA
    2 graduated from high school or ged         1496   1548     NA
    3 attended 2-year school, no degree          823    840     NA
    4 graduated from 2-year school               849    748     NA
    5 attended college, no 4-year degree         859    899     NA
    6 graduated from college                    1737   1729     NA
    7 completed master^s degree or equivalent    911    874     NA
    8 completed phd, md, other advanced degree   503    546     NA
    9 <NA>                                        21     16    819

# Conditional mean

Aside from cross tabulations, finding averages of continuous variables
within groups, sometimes called conditional means, is a common task.
We’ve already done this in the last couple of modules. With base R,
use the `aggregate()` function to compute summary statistics of
continuous values by group.

``` r
## get average math score by parental education 
aggregate(df$bynels2m, by = list(df$bypared), mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

``` 
  Group.1        x
1       1 36.29864
2       2 40.52292
3       3 42.57740
4       4 44.45236
5       5 44.65419
6       6 48.50667
7       7 51.99566
8       8 52.88417
```

Adding a secondary group is not difficult. Just add another variable to
the `by` list. Do demonstrate this, we’ll first create an indicator
variable that equals one if a student’s base year family income was
$25,000 or less and zero otherwise.

``` r
df <- df %>%
    mutate(lowinc = ifelse(byincome <= 7, 1, 0))

## get average math score by low income status and parental education levels
aggregate(df$bynels2m, by = list(df$lowinc, df$bypared), mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

``` 
   Group.1 Group.2        x
1        0       1 36.74020
2        1       1 35.88120
3        0       2 42.09193
4        1       2 37.64148
5        0       3 44.01492
6        1       3 38.03843
7        0       4 45.79327
8        1       4 39.06331
9        0       5 46.01975
10       1       5 38.93340
11       0       6 49.33081
12       1       6 41.50602
13       0       7 52.82858
14       1       7 41.42392
15       0       8 54.15734
16       1       8 38.45988
```

The dplyr way of computing a conditional mean is clearer in some ways
and a little more confusing in others. On one hand, using the
`group_by()` function makes it very clear which is the grouping
variable. On the other hand, the `summarise_at()` function is a bit more
involved. The main thing to remember is that (like with the base R
`aggregate()` function above), you need to pass the `na.rm = TRUE`
argument to the `mean` function. Otherwise, R won’t know what to do with
the missing values and will return `NA`.

``` r
## using dplyr to get average math score by parental education level
df %>%
    group_by(bypared) %>%
    summarise_at(.vars = vars(bynels2m),
                 .funs = funs(mean, .args = list(na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
    as_factor()
```

    # A tibble: 9 x 2
      bypared                                  bynels2m
      <fct>                                       <dbl>
    1 did not finish high school                   36.3
    2 graduated from high school or ged            40.5
    3 attended 2-year school, no degree            42.6
    4 graduated from 2-year school                 44.5
    5 attended college, no 4-year degree           44.7
    6 graduated from college                       48.5
    7 completed master^s degree or equivalent      52.0
    8 completed phd, md, other advanced degree     52.9
    9 <NA>                                         44.8

Once you’ve got the format, finding the conditional mean within a cross
tabulation (group 1 X group 2) is straightforward: just add the variable
to the `group_by()`
function.

``` r
## using dplyr to get average math score by income and parental education level
df %>%
    group_by(bypared, lowinc) %>%
    summarise_at(vars(bynels2m),
                 funs(mean, .args = list(na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
    as_factor()
```

    # A tibble: 18 x 3
    # Groups:   bypared [?]
       bypared                                  lowinc bynels2m
       <fct>                                     <dbl>    <dbl>
     1 did not finish high school                    0     36.7
     2 did not finish high school                    1     35.9
     3 graduated from high school or ged             0     42.1
     4 graduated from high school or ged             1     37.6
     5 attended 2-year school, no degree             0     44.0
     6 attended 2-year school, no degree             1     38.0
     7 graduated from 2-year school                  0     45.8
     8 graduated from 2-year school                  1     39.1
     9 attended college, no 4-year degree            0     46.0
    10 attended college, no 4-year degree            1     38.9
    11 graduated from college                        0     49.3
