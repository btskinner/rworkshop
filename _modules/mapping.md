This module will show some basic mapping tasks, including merging
geospatial data and making an interactive
[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) map. We’ll use spatial data from the
[Charlottesville, VA, open data
portal](http://opendata.charlottesville.org), which will also give us
practice using APIs.

## Requirements

Even though ggplot2 is a part of the tidyverse suite of packages, you
will need to download the development version of ggplot2 from GitHub in
order to plot maps using the new
[sf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf) package. Use the
[devtools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools) package to get
it:

``` r
## get development version of ggplot2 if needed
devtools::install_github('tidyverse/ggplot2')
```

You may also need to install the following libraries on your computer:

  - [GDAL](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadSource)  
  - [GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/)  
  - [PROJ.4](http://download.osgeo.org/proj/)

MacOS users can get these libraries (GDAL Complete) from
[here](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks).

``` r
## libraries
libs <- c('tidyverse','leaflet','sf','RColorBrewer')
lapply(libs, require, character.only = TRUE)
```

# Quick API function

Inspecting the API string used to make a data request, the format across
data sets is fairly regular with a few variations. Though it’s probably
overkill to write a function (and we could probably write a cleaner
one), rewriting the API string over and over again also seems tedious
and error prone.

So here’s function that requires the map server number, the open data
number (which is 1 for both our data sets), and a string vector of the
variables we want, with the default being all of them. We still need to
use the open data portal to figure out what arguments we need to provide
for each data set, but the function will make us a nice API string that
we won’t need to build ourselves.

``` r
## quick function to help use Charlottesville API
cville_api_url <- function(mapserver_number,
                           open_data_number = 1,
                           variable_vector = c('*')) {
    base <- paste0('https://gisweb.charlottesville.org/',
                   'arcgis/rest/services/OpenData_',
                   open_data_number,
                   '/MapServer/')
    mid <- '/query?where=1%3D1&outFields='
    var <- paste(variable_vector, collapse = ',')
    end <- '&outSR=4326&f=json'
    return(paste0(base, mapserver_number, mid, var, end))
}
```

# Request data

First, we’ll get spatial data for the six elementary school catchments
zones in Charlottesville. These only come with the zone name, so we’ll
request all variables.

``` r
## get school link
sch_link <- cville_api_url(mapserver_number = 16)

## get school data
sch <- st_read(sch_link) %>%
    ## lower variable names
    setNames(tolower(names(.))) %>%
    ## rename the unique id for later join
    rename(objectid_sch = objectid)
```

Next, we’ll get census block spatial data. These data also include
population numbers broken out by demographics such as race / ethnicity.
[Because many public schools across the country remain largely
segregated by race in
2018](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/03/school-segregation-is-not-a-myth/555614/),
in practice if no longer by law, investigating the demographic make up
of school catchment zone remains an important task, particularly when
resource allocation and student outcomes are correlated with surrounding
population characteristics.

For this module, we’ll limit the census data to overall population
counts (2010) and available racial/ethnic subgroup counts.

``` r
## get census block data link, with subset of variables
vars <- c('OBJECTID','Block','Population',
          'Hispanic_Origin','NH_Wht','NH_Blk',
          'NH_Ind','NH_Asn')
cba_link <- cville_api_url(mapserver_number = 13,
                           variable_vector = vars)

## get census block data
cba <- st_read(cba_link) %>%
    ## set names to lower
    setNames(tolower(names(.))) %>%
    ## rename for later join and to make names clearer
    rename(objectid_cba = objectid,
           pop = population,      
           amerind = nh_ind,
           asian = nh_asn,
           black = nh_blk,
           hispanic = hispanic_origin,
           white = nh_wht) %>%
    ## create other race/ethnicity category
    mutate(other = pop - amerind - asian - black - hispanic - white)

# Elementary attendance zones

As a first step, let’s plot the elementary school catchment zones using
leaflet. Since we don’t care about the displayed color of each zone
other than they be different to show separation between each, we’ll set
up a `colorFactor()` palette that we’ll then use with the `fillColor`
argument in `addPolygons()`.

Notice how the leaflet functions can be piped together like dplyr
functions. Also notice how arguments that vary by group use a tilde,
`~`, in front of the argument: `~factpal(sch$zone)` and `label = ~zone`.

``` r
## set up color palette that will align
factpal <- colorFactor(palette = brewer.pal(n = length(sch$zone),
                                            name = 'Accent'),
                       domain = as.factor(sch$zone))

## make leaflet map
map <- leaflet(sch) %>%
    addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
    addPolygons(color = 'black', weight = 2,, fillOpacity = .5,
                fillColor = ~factpal(sch$zone), label = ~zone)
map
```

# Census block areas

Next, let’s map the census block areas. Again, we just want to show the
different areas, so the assigned color will just be a random sample of
colors.

``` r
## too many census blocks so will randomly assign indices for colors
cba$group <- factor(sample.int(11L, nrow(cba), replace = TRUE))

## set up color palette that will align with indices
factpal <- colorFactor(palette = brewer.pal(n = 8L, name = 'Accent'),
                       domain = cba$group)

## make leaflet map
map <- leaflet(cba) %>%
    addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
    addPolygons(color = 'black', weight = 2, fillOpacity = .5,
                fillColor = ~factpal(cba$group), label = ~block)
map
```

# Merging spatial data

Here’s our problem: the demographic data in the census blocks needs to
be aggregated up to the school zone areas. To attach census data to
school zones for further analysis, we need to join the spatial data.

This used to be a bit difficult, but the `st_intersection()` function
from the `sf` package makes this join much easier.

``` r
## merge polygons
cba_sch <- st_intersection(cba, sch)
```

    although coordinates are longitude/latitude, st_intersection assumes that they are planar

    Warning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant
    throughout all geometries

That said, the merge isn’t perfect because the underlying spatial data
don’t perfectly align.

> #### Quick exercise

> Check the row counts of the census block data frame and the newly
> merged data frame. How many extra rows are there in the new data
> frame?

Our new data set is larger than the number of census blocks because the
`st_intersection()` function performs a full join, making a row for each
overlap. For census blocks entirely inside one zone, there’s just one
row. But for census blocks that split across more than one district,
there is a row for each zone - block combination.

Let’s zoom in on an example overlap.

``` r
## ---------------------------------------------
## plot one zone as example, making an inset map
## ---------------------------------------------

## primary zoomed in map
g1 <- ggplot(sch) +
    geom_sf() +
    geom_sf(aes(fill = factor(zone)), color = NA,
            data = cba_sch %>% filter(objectid_cba == 28)) +
    coord_sf(xlim = c(-78.514, -78.5035), ylim = c(38.015, 38.023)) +
    guides(fill = guide_legend(title = 'School Zone')) 

## whole Charlottesville map for inset, just wrap in ggplotGlob()
g2 <- ggplotGrob(
    ggplot(sch) +
    geom_sf() +
    geom_sf(aes(fill = factor(zone)), 
            data = cba_sch %>% filter(objectid_cba == 28)) +
    theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white'),
          legend.position = 'none',
          line = element_blank(),
          text = element_blank(),
          axis.ticks = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = 'white'),
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
)

## combine and show
g3 <- g1 +
      annotation_custom(grob = g2, xmin = -78.510, xmax = -78.5018,
                        ymin = 38.019, ymax = 38.0232)
g3
```

Overlaps like these pose a small problem for our calculations since not
everyone in some census blocks lives in the same school zone. Ideally,
we would have household information and be able to aggregate precisely.
But because census blocks are the smallest publicly available unit,
we’ll have to compromise.

An easy solution will be to figure out what proportion of each census
block is in each school zone. For most, it will be 100% inside a single
zone. For the overlapping blocks, we can use these proportions to make
weights that we’ll use when aggregating population counts.

For example if a census block is 10% in one zone and 90% in another, its
population counts will be given a weight of .1 in the first and .9 in
the second. Clearly this solution is imperfect, but it’s easy and will
get us a more accurate answer than some other quick solution (like a
majority decision where a block’s population counts go the zone in which
the majority of its area lies).

We’ll do this in three steps:

1.  Get the area of each sub-part using `st_area()`  
2.  Get the area of each census block from the original `cba` object  
3.  Join these data frames and compute a weight as sub area over full
    area

<!-- end list -->

``` r
## 1. get sub group area
cba_sch <- cba_sch %>%
    mutate(area = st_area(.) %>% as.numeric())

## 2. get original areas of census blocks
cb_area <- cba %>%
    mutate(area = st_area(.) %>% as.numeric()) %>%
    select(block, full_area = area) %>%
    st_set_geometry(NULL)

## 3. join and ...
cba_sch <- cba_sch %>%
    left_join(cb_area) %>%
    ## ...compute fraction as weight
    mutate(prop_w = area / full_area)
```

    Joining, by = "block"

Quickly, let’s check our example overlapping census block group to see
if it passes the sniff test.

``` r
## check our example
cba_sch %>%
    select(block, objectid_cba, area, full_area, prop_w) %>%
    filter(objectid_cba == 28) %>%
    st_set_geometry(NULL)
```

``` 
            block objectid_cba     area full_area     prop_w
1 515400005024000           28 80607.96  83905.59 0.96069836
2 515400005024000           28  3297.62  83905.59 0.03930155
```

Yep, a split of 94% and 6% seems reasonable based on the plot. Forward\!

# Aggregate demographics within each elementary school zone

Now that we’ve joined our census block and school zone data and computed
weights, we can aggregate population counts to each school
zone.

``` r
## get aggregate population counts (weighted by proportion of block in zone)
sch_pop <- cba_sch %>%
    group_by(objectid_sch) %>%
    ## weighted counts...
    summarise(amerind = round(sum(amerind * prop_w)),
              asian = round(sum(asian * prop_w)),
              black = round(sum(black * prop_w)),
              hispanic = round(sum(hispanic * prop_w)),
              other = round(sum(other * prop_w)),
              white = round(sum(white * prop_w))) %>%
    ## ...then total...
    mutate(pop = amerind + asian + black + hispanic + other + white,
           ## ...then proportion
           amerinc_pct = amerind / pop,
           asian_pct = asian / pop,
           black_pct = black / pop,
           hispanic_pct = hispanic / pop,
           other_pct = other / pop,
           white_pct = white / pop) %>%
    st_set_geometry(NULL)

## join with school spatial data
sch <- sch %>% left_join(sch_pop)
```

    Joining, by = "objectid_sch"

Let’s map it. For comparison, we’ll make four maps:

1.  % Black population  
2.  % Hispanic population  
3.  % Asian population  
4.  % White population

<!-- end list -->

``` r
## make leaflet map: % Black population
binpal <- colorBin('Reds', sch$black_pct, 6)
map_bl_pct <- leaflet(sch) %>%
    addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
    addPolygons(color = 'black', weight = 2,, fillOpacity = .5,
                fillColor = ~binpal(black_pct)) %>%
    addLegend('topright', pal = binpal, values = ~black_pct,
              title = '% Black population (2010)')

## make leaflet map: % Hispanic population
binpal <- colorBin('Reds', sch$hispanic_pct, 6)
map_hi_pct <- leaflet(sch) %>%
    addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
    addPolygons(color = 'black', weight = 2,, fillOpacity = .5,
                fillColor = ~binpal(hispanic_pct)) %>%
    addLegend('topright', pal = binpal, values = ~hispanic_pct,
              title = '% Hispanic population (2010)')

## make leaflet map: % Asian population
binpal <- colorBin('Reds', sch$asian_pct, 6)
map_as_pct <- leaflet(sch) %>%
    addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
    addPolygons(color = 'black', weight = 2,, fillOpacity = .5,
                fillColor = ~binpal(asian_pct)) %>%
    addLegend('topright', pal = binpal, values = ~asian_pct,
              title = '% Asian population (2010)')

## make leaflet map: % White population
binpal <- colorBin('Reds', sch$white_pct, 6)
map_wh_pct <- leaflet(sch) %>%
    addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
    addPolygons(color = 'black', weight = 2,, fillOpacity = .5,
                fillColor = ~binpal(white_pct)) %>%
    addLegend('topright', pal = binpal, values = ~white_pct,
              title = '% White population (2010)')

Noting that these maps use older data, show demographic percentages of
residents in the census block (not necessarily element school students),
and rely on some assumptions about how to divide population among
overlapping census blocks, they do suggest demographic differences
across elementary school catchment zones within the city.

The next step would be to link these data with information about each
school from the [Common Core of
Data](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp) or the [Virginia
Department of
Education](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/statistics_reports/index.shtml#)
to see whether demographic differences are associated with
characteristics of the schools.
